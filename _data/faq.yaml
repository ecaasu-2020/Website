    and high school students also have a discounted fee of $40. We will be releasing

- question: How do I get to the conference?
  answer: |-
    For attendees traveling from Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, NJ, the DMV, and other areas from the Mid-Atlantic region, we recommend bussing or driving. The Greyhound and Megabus buses depart from most major cities to downtown Pittsburgh, and each drop off at a 10 minute bus or shuttle ride to the Wyndham Hotel.

    For attendees coming from states outside of the Mid-Atlantic region (ex. Florida, New England), we recommend flying in. The nearest airport is the Pittsburgh International Airport at 1000 Airport Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15231.
- question: Where can I park in Pittsburgh?
  answer: |-
    Valet parking is available at the hotel for $35 a night. Overnight self parking garages can be found near the hotel for a fee.

    Street/public garage parking can be paid for at the meters or through the Go Mobile PGH app and rates vary by location. Parking throughout the city is free after 6 PM and Sunday.
