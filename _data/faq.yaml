questions:
- question: How do I get to ECAASU Conference?
  answer: |-
    For attendees traveling from Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, NJ, the DMV, and other areas from the Mid-Atlantic region, we recommend bussing or driving. The Greyhound and Megabus buses depart from most major cities to downtown Pittsburgh, and each drop off at a 10 minute bus or shuttle ride to the Wyndham Hotel.

    For attendees coming from states outside of the Mid-Atlantic region (ex. Florida, New England), we recommend flying in. The nearest airport is the Pittsburgh International Airport at 1000 Airport Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15231.
