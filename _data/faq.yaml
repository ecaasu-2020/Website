- question: How do I get to the conference?
  answer: |-
    For attendees traveling from Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, NJ, the DMV, and other areas from the Mid-Atlantic region, we recommend bussing or driving. The Greyhound and Megabus buses depart from most major cities to downtown Pittsburgh, and each drop off at a 10 minute bus or shuttle ride to the Wyndham Hotel.
    <br/><br/>
    For attendees coming from states outside of the Mid-Atlantic region (ex. Florida, New England), we recommend flying in. The nearest airport is the Pittsburgh International Airport at 1000 Airport Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15231.
- question: Where can I park in Pittsburgh?
  answer: |-
    Valet parking is available at the hotel for $35 a night. Overnight self parking garages can be found near the hotel for a fee.
    <br/><br/>
    Street/public garage parking can be paid for at the meters or through the Go Mobile PGH app and rates vary by location. Parking throughout the city is free after 6 PM and Sunday.

- question: If you are a CMU/University of Pittsburgh student, is transportation included?
  answer: "We will be providing transportation from CMU to University of Pittsburgh
    and University of Pittsburgh to Wyndham Grand on Saturday (in between workshop
    venues and workshop venues--> hotel/closing ceremony) but we will not be providing
    transportation from Wyndham Grand to CMU on Saturday morning. The best way to
    get around Pittsburgh is either through Lyft/Uber or through the Port Authority
    bus system. \n<br /><br />\nSingle-day bus passes are available for $7 if you
    want unlimited rides to go around Pittsburgh (you can use this to go in between
    workshop venues, to & from the hotel, and to different neighborhoods), getting
    a rechargeable connect card ($1 for a new card + $2.50 per ride; need one card
    per person), or paying with cash on the bus (one-way ride is $2.75 per person).
    You can buy passes/connect cards right next to the hotel at Gateway Station on
    Liberty Ave. & Stanwix St. or any other locations listed <a href=\" https://www.portauthority.org/fares-and-passes/connectcard/connectcard-locations/\">here</a>.
