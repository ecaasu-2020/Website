- name: Developing your Story of Self
  block: Steel
  track: Track 1
  host: Ridhwan Sediqe
  location: ''
  description: One of the most daunting tasks that college students face is answering
    the ever-important question, “who are you?” Whether you’re a leader in a student
    organization, a community organizer, or just trying to prepare for an interview,
    having the tools to reflect on and share stories is essential to being successful.
    Each of us has unique stories to share about the ideas and experiences that define
    us. This workshop will introduce the “story of self” as a framework for reflecting
    on our own experiences in order to communicate who we are. This workshop is a
    great opportunity for both beginners and experienced leaders to practice using
    a unique tool that has helped Presidents and activists identify the essence of
    their passion and sense of community.
- name: Fandom and the Asian American Community
  block: Steel
  track: Track 1
  host: Linda Kuo
  location: ''
  description: This workshop will explore how the participatory and transformative
    nature of engaging in fandom could contribute towards Asian American community
    building. From Kpop to anime to actual Asian American representations, we have
    found sources of social support and ethnic connection from actively interacting
    with the media we consume. We will cover fan studies as an emerging field, especially
    in convergence with critical race studies and trans-media storytelling. Come discuss
    your experiences and thoughts on fandom and creative productions such as fan fiction
    and fan-art! Let’s put these world-making and character development elements to
    practice by creating your own personalized tarot card as a creative fan practice.

  location: ''
  description: "\"AAPIs have been described as a “model minority” since the 1960s,\nbut
    how do different AAPI generations today view that label? Furthermore, \nhow do
    their ethnic and generational identification influence their experience\nwith
    the stereotype in America? “(Re)Model Minority: Intergenerational Perspectives
    \non the Myth” will present an overview of the history of the model minority stereotype
    \n(MMS) and research on intergenerational differences in perceptions of the MMS,
    \nspecifically among 1st-, 1.5-, and 2nd-generation Asian Americans. \nWe will
    discuss our differences in navigating the MMS, \nwhat intergenerational conflicts
    arise due to these differences, and how we can \nmanage these tensions.\""
