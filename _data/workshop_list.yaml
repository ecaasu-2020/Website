- name: Third World Liberation Front
  block: "2"
  track: Track 2
  host: Krysty Shen
  location: ''
  description: The first Asian American Studies program was born out of student and
    community activism. Noticing that their experiences and needs were ignored and
    overlooked, students of color at San Francisco State took action and organized
    a strike. Beginning on November 6, 1969 and ending on March 20, 1969, the Third
    World Liberation Front, a coalition of six student organizations at San Francisco
    State, led the longest college strike in American history. The four-month long
    strike established the first School (now College) of Ethnic Studies, and Asian
    American Studies within the School. Looking at some key players of the TWLF Strike,
    this workshop will inform students about the origins of Ethnic Studies and inspire
    students to expand Ethnic Studies in their own schools.

- name: 'Colorism the Daughter of Racism: A Narrative on Diversified Identities'
  block: "2"
  track: Track 2
  host: Celina Wong
  location: ''
  description: 'Throughout history, European colonialism led to the racist notion
    of European powers as superior over other nations. Although colonies may have
    gained independence, there are still long lasting effects in these communities,
    one of them being colorism. Media representation and beauty ads display whiteness
    as “superior”. For communities that have been affected by colonialism, their identity
    may be difficult to navigate. This workshop will aim to explain where colorism
    stems from and its effects within communities by telling a narrative of two communities
    with diverse identities: the Chinese Jamcaican and Filipino one.'

  track: Track 1
  host: Sam Agtarap, Julianne Williams, Steven Rubio
  location: ''
  description: In many Asian-American households, food is our love language. However,
    food can also be the enemy. We’ll talk about contradictions such as being told
    to eat more and then being called “fat” afterwards, discuss how our cultures and
    society created irrational beauty standards we force ourselves to uphold, challenge
    the notion that we must be silent about eating disorders, and reflect on what
    is our relationship with food- and if it is healthy or unhealthy. This workshop
    will be mainly discussion and educational based. We will have some activities
    to hopefully get individuals out of their shell and really want to talk about
    these pressing issues!

  description: One of the most daunting tasks that college students face is answering
    the ever-important question, “who are you?” Whether you’re a leader in a student
    organization, a community organizer, or just trying to prepare for an interview,
    having the tools to reflect on and share stories is essential to being successful.
    Each of us has unique stories to share about the ideas and experiences that define
    us. This workshop will introduce the “story of self” as a framework for reflecting
    on our own experiences in order to communicate who we are. This workshop is a

  track: Track 1
  host: Naeem Aziz, Lauren Yu
  location: ''
  description: '"We all know that dreaded phrase: “I’m a pre-med.” And we all know
    the immediate assumptions we make about those who speak that phrase: they are
    smart, hard-working, arrogant, and yes, some of are probably thinking it, Asian.
    Our society has created a stereotype around Asians and Asian Americans, painting
    them as the “model minority” and often implying that they should and do occupy
    the highest tier of careers, which tends to mean doctors, pharmacists, dentists.
    However, there is a major population of Asians and Pacific Islanders that are
    often not talked about or even considered; those who occupy the so-called “low
    tier” health care professions, such as nurses, home aides, etc. So why is that
    Asians and Pacific Islanders have come to be boxed into these “elite” roles, and
    why have we left a major portion of the demographic out of the discussion?"'
