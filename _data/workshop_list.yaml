  block: "2"

  host: Janani Guru
  location: ''
  description: "\"The AAPI population is the most socioeconomically divided racial
    group \nin the United States. Often cited as the wealthiest and most educated
    group in \nAmerica, income inequality within the population is very much overlooked.
    \nThis disparity has impacts in political influence, media representation, education,
    \nand representation as a whole. This workshop analyzes the causes of this gap,
    \nhow it affects various Asian-American cohorts, and the ramifications this has
    on \nthe Asian-American society as a whole.\""
- name: 'Colorism the Daughter of Racism: A Narrative on Diversified Identities'
  block: "2"
  track: Track 2
  host: Celina Wong
  location: ''
  description: 'Throughout history, European colonialism led to the racist notion
    of European powers as superior over other nations. Although colonies may have
    gained independence, there are still long lasting effects in these communities,
    one of them being colorism. Media representation and beauty ads display whiteness
    as “superior”. For communities that have been affected by colonialism, their identity
    may be difficult to navigate. This workshop will aim to explain where colorism
    stems from and its effects within communities by telling a narrative of two communities
    with diverse identities: the Chinese Jamcaican and Filipino one.'

  location: ''
  description: One of the most daunting tasks that college students face is answering
    the ever-important question, “who are you?” Whether you’re a leader in a student
    organization, a community organizer, or just trying to prepare for an interview,
    having the tools to reflect on and share stories is essential to being successful.
    Each of us has unique stories to share about the ideas and experiences that define
    us. This workshop will introduce the “story of self” as a framework for reflecting
    on our own experiences in order to communicate who we are. This workshop is a
    great opportunity for both beginners and experienced leaders to practice using
    a unique tool that has helped Presidents and activists identify the essence of
    their passion and sense of community.
- name: Fandom and the Asian American Community
  block: "1"
  track: Track 1
  host: Linda Kuo
  location: ''
  description: This workshop will explore how the participatory and transformative
    nature of engaging in fandom could contribute towards Asian American community
    building. From Kpop to anime to actual Asian American representations, we have
    found sources of social support and ethnic connection from actively interacting
    with the media we consume. We will cover fan studies as an emerging field, especially
    in convergence with critical race studies and trans-media storytelling. Come discuss
    your experiences and thoughts on fandom and creative productions such as fan fiction
    and fan-art! Let’s put these world-making and character development elements to
    practice by creating your own personalized tarot card as a creative fan practice.

  track: Track 2
  host: Dahyun Jessica Jeong & Emily Ye
  location: ''
  description: "\"AAPIs have been described as a “model minority” since the 1960s,\nbut
    how do different AAPI generations today view that label? Furthermore, \nhow do
    their ethnic and generational identification influence their experience\nwith
    the stereotype in America? “(Re)Model Minority: Intergenerational Perspectives
    \non the Myth” will present an overview of the history of the model minority stereotype
    \n(MMS) and research on intergenerational differences in perceptions of the MMS,
    \nspecifically among 1st-, 1.5-, and 2nd-generation Asian Americans. \nWe will
    discuss our differences in navigating the MMS, \nwhat intergenerational conflicts
    arise due to these differences, and how we can \nmanage these tensions.\""
- name: AAPI in Healthcare Professions
  block: "2"
  track: Track 1
  host: Naeem Aziz, Lauren Yu
  location: ''
  description: '"We all know that dreaded phrase: “I’m a pre-med.” And we all know
    the immediate assumptions we make about those who speak that phrase: they are
    smart, hard-working, arrogant, and yes, some of are probably thinking it, Asian.
    Our society has created a stereotype around Asians and Asian Americans, painting
    them as the “model minority” and often implying that they should and do occupy
    the highest tier of careers, which tends to mean doctors, pharmacists, dentists.
    However, there is a major population of Asians and Pacific Islanders that are
    often not talked about or even considered; those who occupy the so-called “low
    tier” health care professions, such as nurses, home aides, etc. So why is that
    Asians and Pacific Islanders have come to be boxed into these “elite” roles, and
    why have we left a major portion of the demographic out of the discussion?"'

  description: When asked to think of some words used to describe Asian women, you

    action within the Asian American community. In this workshop, we will be discussing

    how we are viewed in the higher education system. (2) How the education system
    has historically excluded minority groups (3) What actions have been taken by
    the APIA community to combat issues revolving around anti-affirmative-action legislation?
    (4) How to build solidarity with other racial groups that have been damaged affected
    by affirmative action.
