- name: 'Kashmir: The Struggle for Self-Determination'
  block: "3"
  track: International Relations/History
  host: Shajei Haider
  location: University of Pittsburgh, Cathedral of Learning, CL 202
  description: August 5, 2019 marked a new phase in India's ongoing occupation of
    Kashmir. Under the Hindu nationalist government led by PM Narendra Modi, the Indian
    state revoked the constitutionally guaranteed autonomy of the Kashmir region,
    and enforced this action through an additional deployment of troops in what is
    already the world's most militarized region. It also instituted a clampdown on
    communications and arrested thousands of Kashmiri leaders, civil society activists,
    journalists, lawyers, and students. In this workshop, the instructor will provide
    insights into the current situation, as well as place it in a larger historical
    and political context of the Kashmiri struggle for self-determination.

  block: "3"
  track: Civic Engagement
  host: Sam Yu, Emma Wexler, Esther Jeon
  location: University of Pittsburgh,Cathedral of Learning, CL 218
  description: As Asian Americans, our political identity and histories are inextricably
    tied to the United States immigration system. 1 in 7 Asian Americans are undocumented,
    and 35,000 intercountry adoptees live without citizenship today. How, then, do
    we build power to achieve a just immigration system in the United States? What
    would a just immigration system for our community look like? In this workshop,
    we explore our personal ties to migration and review past migrant justice campaigns
    to strategize ways to achieve our vision for migrant liberation in the United
    States. Participants will be encouraged to come up with and collaborate on ways
    to advocate/actualize/enact/fight for migrant justice in their local communities.
- name: Third World Liberation Front
  block: "3"
  track: International Relations/History
  host: Krysty Shen
  location: University of Pittsburgh, Cathedral of Learning, CL 349
  description: 'The first Asian American Studies program was born out of student and
    community activism. Noticing that their experiences and needs were ignored and
    overlooked, students of color at San Francisco State took action and organized
    a strike. Beginning on November 6, 1969 and ending on March 20, 1969, the Third
    World Liberation Front, a coalition of six student organizations at San Francisco
    State, led the longest college strike in American history. The four-month long
    strike established the first School (now College) of Ethnic Studies, and Asian
    American Studies within the School. Looking at some key players of the TWLF Strike,
    this workshop will inform students about the origins of Ethnic Studies and inspire
    students to expand Ethnic Studies in their own schools. '
- name: The Role of AAPI Communities in the Environmental Justice Movement
  block: "3"
  track: Deep Dive
  host: Zoya Goodwin, Rozette De Castro
  location: University of Pittsburgh,Cathedral of Learning, CL 363
  description: 'This workshop will aim to inspire audience and  to create a passionate
    drive on environmental justice by tapping into one’s own personal interactions
    with nature and the emotions that are evoked during that interaction - especially
    as an AAPI. To do so, we will be initially asking questions around identity and
    community to stimulate discussion on how as AAPI, we are partially influenced
    by the community we grew up in. Then we will tie this in with how  identity as
    an AAPI and your community intertwined with the environment directly and indirectly.
    The general question is on why should the AAPI community care about the environment. '

  location: University of Pittsburgh, Cathedral of Learning, CL 226
  description: 'In this workshop, we seek to educate and bring awareness to the current
    deportation crisis of Cambodian refugees in the United States. The workshop will
    briefly discuss how the Vietnam War and American involvement brought rise to the
    Khmer Rouge Regime, and eventually the Cambodian Genocide. Next we will delve
    into how the assimilation and lack of resources for Cambodian refugees has led
    to conditions that allow for unjust deportation back to a country they have never
    known. The workshop will feature an immersive, interactive activity, elucidating
    the difficult situations Cambodian refugees face. Content Warning: Death/genocide,
    mental illness, deportation, violence/gang violence.'

  location: University of Pittsburgh, Cathedral of Learning, CL 235
  description: The 2020 Census is critical for more than 22 million Asian Americans
    and Pacific Islanders (AAPIs). As the fastest-growing population, AAPIs have to
    ensure our communities are accurately counted and represented. Census data determines

  host: Maddie Schumacher
  location: University of Pittsburgh,Cathedral of Learning, CL 252
  description: 'Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated precisely one year after giving
    his 1967 ‘Beyond Vietnam’ speech. In it, he advised that the oppressive situations
    felt by Black Americans and Vietnamese communities were not so different: both

    without the Department of Homeland Security look like? This workshop will give
    a basic overview of the various ways you can influence laws and actions in the
    US and a brief history of the creation of DHS, and then you’ll have a chance to

  block: "3"
  track: Civic Engagement
  host: Helena Wong
  location: University of Pittsburgh, Cathedral of Learning, CL 204
  description: Asian Americans have always been involved in movements for justice.
    In this period of escalated attacks on communities of color, poor communities,
    LGBTQ people, women's bodies, the environment, etc., it is important for us to
    build a common language and across identities. Facilitator(s) will work with participants

- name: 'Towards a Transnational Perspective of Race (AAPIs and International Relations) '
  block: "3"
  track: International Relations/History
  host: Jessie Huang
  location: University of Pittsburgh, Cathedral of Learning, CL 242
  description: For many people growing up in the United States, their understanding
    of race and racial inequity is rooted in the United States - what has happened
    in this country, at its “borders,” and at the outposts of the government’s ongoing
    colonizing efforts. But how can that understanding give light to or cloud perspectives
    on race issues that take place outside of the United States - specifically in
    the countries where some of our communities’ ancestors migrated from? This workshop
    will examine historical and current events, such as the Uyghur detention camps
    in China, to understand the place and impact of AAPIs in navigating race issues
    outside of the American context.
- name: Power at the Polls! AAPIs and the 2020 Elections

  track: Civic Engagement
  host: Julie Wu
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Baker Hall, BH A53
  description: It's election season, the stakes are high, and the voices of young
    voters are more critical than ever! Where does the Asian American and Pacific
    Islander (AAPI) community currently stand in its participation at the polls? What
    are the barriers that keep our community members from the polls? How can we convince
    our families and friends to stay civically engaged? Attendees will walk away with
    an understanding about the growth and power of the AAPI electorate – along with
    ideas to take action and engage their campus communities and networks. Together
    we will work to amplify AAPI voices and ensure that our community shows up at
    the polls in record numbers this election cycle!
- name: 'Boundaries Within Community: Imagining Accessible AAPI Spaces'
  block: "2"
  track: The Fundamentals
  host: Cheyenne Cheng
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Porter Hall, PH 225A
  description: 'Disability comes in many different forms. Some are visible, while
    others are not. Considered the largest “minority” group, the disability community
    is one of the most diverse, spanning different identities from race, gender, class,
    and so forth. With the Americans with Disability Act turning 30 this year, it’s
    a good time to reflect on the spaces we inhabit and in what ways we make them
    more or less accessible. What is it like being AAPI and disabled? How does our
    cultural background inform our perceptions of disabilities? How do we make student
    orgs, leadership positions, and our programming more accessible? This workshop
    will cover the basics of disability justice and ableism, how the intersection
    of being AAPI and disabled manifests, and how one can make student organizational
    spaces more accessible. '
- name: 'Building Power: AAPIs in the Labor Movement'
  block: "2"
  track: Civic Engagement
  host: Sabrina Yow-chyi Liu, Judy Suh
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, TEP 2002
  description: Asian American and Pacific Islander activists played important roles
    to fight for better working and living conditions throughout the history in the
    United States, and yet AAPI leaders are often invisible in the dominant narrative.
    This workshop will spotlight key AAPI leaders and crucial moments in U.S. history
    where AAPI workers forge solidarity to build a unified front to demand better
    lives and build a stronger community. The workshop will then invite participants
    to reflect on differences workers can make by standing together. This workshop
    will bridge our proud history and present-day by sharing coalition building examples
    in Pittsburgh.

  description: 'How often can you give a gift that not only helps to save a life now,
    but continues to save lives for years to come? How often do you get to personalize
    your giving and receive direct, measurable results in real-time? Probably not
    too often, but with Gift of Life Marrow Registry you can! This workshop will tackle
    the health disparities within the Asian American community and empower you to
    change the odds for AAPI patients in need. We will dispel the common myths associated
    with blood stem cell and marrow donation because donation is not what you think.

    to win amazing giveaways.   '
- name: Erasing the Shame around Mental Health for AAPIs
  block: "2"
  track: Mental Health
  host: JR Kuo, Marian Lien
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Baker Hall, BH A51
  description: In many Asian-American households, children grow up controlling or
    hiding their emotions. If you’re “too emotional,” you may be perceived as someone
    who complains too much and doesn’t try to solve anything for themselves. This
    often translates to family environments in which silence is a sign of strength
    and feelings aren’t likely shared. You may even be expected to move forward regardless
    of how you’re feeling, or risk being perceived as someone who easily accepts failure.
    If this sounds familiar, then this session is for you! Come and explore with us
    how cultural fear and shame feeds the stigmas around mental health in our AAPI
    communities. Learn how to identify ways you can ask for help and prioritize your
    own health or those you care for.

    Discourse'
  block: "2"
  track: The Fundamentals
  host: Shania Khoo, Vinh Dang
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, TEP 2003
  description: 'Do you ever notice that Hollywood movies and TV Shows are severely
    lacking in non-East Asian representation (despite the multitude of achievements
    of Asians in media)? This workshop will be centered around the questions of who
    is and who gets to be “Asian”?; why are certain groups of Asians getting erased
    from broader AAPI discourse?; and what can we be doing to combat this? We will
    dive into the historical contexts that have led to the erasure of non-East Asians,
    the policies that discriminate against non-East Asians, and brainstorm strategies
    to combat East Asian dominance in AAPI spaces. Come and learn how we can be more
    intentional about decentering East Asians and uplifting underrepresented Asians
    in Asian American spaces. Join the discussion! '

  host: Nguyễn Anh Thư
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Tepper School of Business, TEP 2701
  description: Up until recently, Asian Americans have had both similar but vastly
    different experiences growing up and understanding, if at all, their identiti(es).
    However, with the formation of global online Asian diaspora culture through Asian
    Twitter and other platforms, how are these experiences changing? Using Jean Kim’s
    5 Stages of Asian American Identity, we’ll explore today’s landscape of identity
    formation.
- name: Asian American Pacific Islander vs  Asian American AND Pacific Islander

  track: Deep Dive
  host: Kimberly Moya, Kenzo Senaha Kimura
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Porter Hall, PH 225A
  description: Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have formed lasting coalitions
    and often work together on common issues, but cross-racial collaboration is not
    grounds for ignoring the needs of either ethnic group. This workshop will focus
    on how clumping together Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders as a group has
    affected the Pacific Islander communities especially for students and their families.
- name: Peace, Love, Understanding Rave Culture in the Asian American Community

  track: Pop Culture
  host: Stephanie Wang, Jeremy Xue
  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Porter Hall, PH 226A
  description: Have you ever wondered why there are so many Asian Americans at Electronic
    Dance Music (EDM) festivals? In this discussion-based workshop, we will explore
    why the EDM and rave subculture is so prevalent within the Asian American community
    and its sociological implication in developing Asian American identity. We will
    examine Asian American identity as “perpetual foreigners” in their search for
    a cultural home and belonging, and how they negotiate their subjectivities in
    relation to the contemporary EDM festival scene.

    2020 Census is an opportunity for AANHPIs to ensure our communities are not erased
    from the data that tells this nation's story and receive our fair share of resources
    and political power. Attendees will participate in an interactive simulation that
    demonstrates how important this once-a-decade event truly is, the barriers to

  location: Carnegie Mellon University, Porter Hall, PH 100
  description: Imperialism is a system of power, influence, and policy that has shaped
    the world in which we live and continues to reproduce global inequalities. In
    this workshop, we will define imperialism and trace its origins and histories,
    as well as its links to White supremacy and capitalism. We’ll focus our exploration
    on countries in Southeast Asia, using specific examples to investigate how imperialism
    continues to impact “formerly” colonized places. This workshop is open to people
    of all backgrounds, regardless of prior engagement with this material; the goal
    of this workshop is to recognize and contextualize forms of imperialism, especially
    as it relates to current conversations of global policy.

  description: Have you ever felt excluded? Or even, have you ever excluded someone?
    As you begin to reflect on the idea of inclusiveness in your daily life, this
    workshop will provide individuals with a historical and practical framework to
    help folks recognize and respond to exclusivity within their communities. During
    this time, we will explore barriers to sustaining welcoming spaces, community
    health and burnout, and Cancel Culture. Ultimately, we hope to equip individuals
    with the tools to combat the polarization of communities, so that we can learn
    to build coalitions, keep ourselves accountable, and continually practicing inclusivity
    in our day-to-day.

  description: One of the most daunting tasks that college students face is answering
    the ever-important question, “who are you?” Whether you’re a leader in a student
    organization, a community organizer, or just trying to prepare for an interview,
    having the tools to reflect on and share stories is essential to being successful.
    Each of us has unique stories to share about the ideas and experiences that define
    us. This workshop will introduce the “story of self” as a framework for reflecting
    on our own experiences in order to communicate who we are. This workshop is a
    great opportunity for both beginners and experienced leaders to practice using
    a unique tool that has helped Presidents and activists identify the essence of
    their passion and sense of community.

  description: This workshop will explore how the participatory and transformative
    nature of engaging in fandom could contribute towards Asian American community
    building. From Kpop to anime to actual Asian American representations, we have
    found sources of social support and ethnic connection from actively interacting
    with the media we consume. We will cover fan studies as an emerging field, especially
    in convergence with critical race studies and trans-media storytelling. Come discuss
    your experiences and thoughts on fandom and creative productions such as fan fiction
    and fan-art! Let’s put these world-making and character development elements to
    practice by creating your own personalized tarot card as a creative fan practice.

    how do different AAPI generations today view that label? Furthermore, \nhow do

    \non the Myth” will present an overview of the history of the model minority stereotype
    \n(MMS) and research on intergenerational differences in perceptions of the MMS,
    \nspecifically among 1st-, 1.5-, and 2nd-generation Asian Americans. \nWe will
    discuss our differences in navigating the MMS, \nwhat intergenerational conflicts
    arise due to these differences, and how we can \nmanage these tensions.\""

  description: '"We all know that dreaded phrase: “I’m a pre-med.” And we all know
    the immediate assumptions we make about those who speak that phrase: they are
    smart, hard-working, arrogant, and yes, some of are probably thinking it, Asian.
    Our society has created a stereotype around Asians and Asian Americans, painting
    them as the “model minority” and often implying that they should and do occupy
    the highest tier of careers, which tends to mean doctors, pharmacists, dentists.
    However, there is a major population of Asians and Pacific Islanders that are
    often not talked about or even considered; those who occupy the so-called “low
    tier” health care professions, such as nurses, home aides, etc. So why is that
    Asians and Pacific Islanders have come to be boxed into these “elite” roles, and
    why have we left a major portion of the demographic out of the discussion?"'

  description: When asked to think of some words used to describe Asian women, you
    will often find contradictory terms floating around. Innocent. Sexy. Subservient.
    Dominant. Why is it that there are 2 distinct, opposite depictions of Asian women?
    The purpose of this workshop is to explore common stereotypes of Asian women throughout
    history and learn how these roles can play into the fetishization of Asian women.

  description: Join us in this workshop where we will examine the effects of affirmative
    action within the Asian American community. In this workshop, we will be discussing
    (1) How Asian Americans are perceived in America with a more focused scope on
    how we are viewed in the higher education system. (2) How the education system
    has historically excluded minority groups (3) What actions have been taken by
    the APIA community to combat issues revolving around anti-affirmative-action legislation?
    (4) How to build solidarity with other racial groups that have been damaged affected
    by affirmative action.
