    worker, sex therapist, adjunct lecturer, and grassroots organizer. Based in Philly
    (licensed in NJ and PA), she is a superfat queer bisexual non-binary therapist

    body image issues, racial or immigrant identity issues, and South Asian family

    beauty ideal. And they continue to draw the ire of white supremacists everywhere
    with controversial statements on intersectional fat liberation since then. Sonalee

    workshops that whisper to our change-making spirit and nourish our vision for
